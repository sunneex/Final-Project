# Final-Project

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pythonshop

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An app that lets you edit and save photos.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan to create an app that will edit photos the user inputs. I plan to include basic editing features like sharpen, blur, crop, rotate, saturation, etc. You then will be able to save the altered image. Maybe there will be a feature of built-in filters for quick editing. I know I will need to use the tkinter library and maybe another external library. 

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

My project will be a small photo editor that anyone can use to make quick adjustments to a picture.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish the basic editing features for the app and a basic layout.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can create an app that works and has a couple editing options.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to begin thinking about all of the features I want exactly. Then, I need to look more into creating apps in Python. I know I need to learn more about the PIL Library because I will need to use it in my project.
